## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Blue checkmarks don't appear

**Check Window 1 (Sender) Console:**
- Should see: `👁️ Messages seen by:`
- If missing: Check if Window 2 is connected

**Check Window 2 (Receiver) Console:**
- Should see: `📖 Auto-marking X messages`
- If missing: Check if socket is connected

**Check Server Console:**
- Should see: `👁️ Marked X messages as read`
- If missing: Check server is running

### Issue: Messages stay at ✓✓ gray

**This means:**
- ✅ Message was delivered (receiver got it)
- ❌ Receiver hasn't opened the chat yet
- NOT a bug if receiver hasn't clicked on the chat!

**To fix:**
- Receiver must click/open the chat
- Then it will turn blue on sender's side

### Issue: Need to refresh to see updates

**This means the fix didn't work. Check:**

1. **Did you restart both servers?**
   ```bash
   # Kill and restart
   cd server && npm start
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Look in browser console (F12)
   - Look in server terminal

| Message seen | 200-300ms | ❌ No |

## Success Criteria

✅ **Test PASSES if:**
- All status changes happen without page refresh
- Console shows expected logs
- Timing is under 500ms for seen status
- Works for single and multiple messages

## Video Recording Suggestion

Record your screen while testing to verify:
1. Window 1 sends message
2. Window 2 receives and opens chat
3. Window 1 shows blue checkmarks **without refresh**

If this works → ✅ **PERFECT!**
If this fails → Check console logs and server

---

**TL;DR: Send message → Receiver opens chat → Sender sees blue ✓✓ INSTANTLY. No refresh needed!** 🎉
