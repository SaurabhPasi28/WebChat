# Vercel Deployment Fix for File Upload

## The Problem

When deployed on Vercel, file upload returns **405 Method Not Allowed** because:
- Frontend tries to send files to `/api/file/upload` 
- Vercel intercepts this as a local API route (not proxied to Render backend)
- Vercel's static hosting doesn't support file uploads

## The Solution

Configure frontend to use Render backend URL directly.

## Step 1: Update Environment Variables on Vercel

Go to your Vercel project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

Add these variables:

### For Production
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-name.onrender.com
```

**Replace `your-backend-name` with your actual Render service name!**

Example:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://webchat-backend-xyz.onrender.com/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://webchat-backend-xyz.onrender.com
```

### For Preview/Development (Optional)
If you want different URLs for preview deployments:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://webchat-staging.onrender.com/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://webchat-staging.onrender.com
```

## Step 2: Redeploy Frontend

After adding environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click the three dots on the latest deployment ‚Üí "Redeploy"
3. Make sure "Use existing Build Cache" is **UNCHECKED**
4. Click "Redeploy"

**Or** trigger a new deployment by pushing to Git.

## Step 3: Update CORS on Render Backend

Your Render backend needs to allow requests from Vercel:

1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Environment
2. Update `CLIENT_URL` environment variable:
   ```
   CLIENT_URL=https://web-chat-lac.vercel.app
   ```
3. **Or for multiple domains:**
   ```
   CLIENT_URL=https://web-chat-lac.vercel.app,https://www.your-custom-domain.com
   ```
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Wait for service to restart

## Step 4: Verify Environment Variables

After redeployment, verify the variables are loaded:

### Check in Browser Console:
```javascript
console.log('API URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL);
console.log('Socket URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SOCKET_URL);
```

Should show:
```
API URL: https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api
Socket URL: https://your-backend-name.onrender.com
```

If it shows `undefined`, the environment variables weren't loaded. Redeploy without cache.

## Step 5: Test File Upload

1. Open your deployed app: `https://web-chat-lac.vercel.app`
2. Log in
3. Select a user
4. Try uploading a small file (< 5MB first)
5. Check browser console for errors
6. Check Render logs for backend errors

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Still getting 405 Error

**Cause**: Environment variables not loaded

**Fix**:
1. Verify variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Redeploy **without** build cache
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue 2: CORS Error

**Cause**: Backend not allowing Vercel domain

**Fix**:
1. Check `CLIENT_URL` on Render matches exactly
2. Include protocol: `https://` not just domain
3. No trailing slash: `https://app.vercel.app` not `https://app.vercel.app/`
4. Restart Render service after changing env vars

### Issue 3: Socket Connection Failed

**Cause**: `VITE_SOCKET_URL` incorrect or not set

**Fix**:
1. Ensure `VITE_SOCKET_URL` set on Vercel
2. Must be same domain as backend: `https://backend.onrender.com`
3. No `/api` at the end for socket URL
4. Redeploy without cache

### Issue 4: File Upload Timeout

**Cause**: Render free tier limitations or large files

**Fix**:
1. Reduce max file size to 20MB
2. Show upload progress to users
3. Consider upgrading Render plan
4. Optimize images before upload

### Issue 5: Environment Variables Not Working

**Cause**: Not prefixed with `VITE_`

**Fix**:
- Vite only exposes vars starting with `VITE_`
- Must use: `VITE_API_URL` not `API_URL`
- Must use: `VITE_SOCKET_URL` not `SOCKET_URL`

## Verification Checklist

Before testing, verify:

- [ ] `VITE_API_URL` set on Vercel
- [ ] `VITE_SOCKET_URL` set on Vercel  
- [ ] Both point to Render backend URL
- [ ] `CLIENT_URL` on Render points to Vercel URL
- [ ] Frontend redeployed without cache
- [ ] Backend restarted after env changes
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Console shows correct URLs

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can load the app
- [ ] Can log in
- [ ] Can send text messages
- [ ] Can receive messages
- [ ] Can see online/offline status
- [ ] **Can upload small file (< 5MB)**
- [ ] **Can upload medium file (< 20MB)**
- [ ] Can download uploaded files
- [ ] Can delete messages with files
- [ ] Real-time updates work

## File Size Recommendations

### Render Free Tier
- **Max recommended**: 20MB per file
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Memory**: 512MB

### Good Limits for Production
```javascript
// In your code
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 20 * 1024 * 1024; // 20MB

if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
  alert('File too large! Maximum size is 20MB');
  return;
}
```

## Monitoring

### Check if Backend is Sleeping (Render Free Tier)
```bash
curl https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

If it takes >5 seconds, backend was sleeping (normal on free tier).

### Check Logs

**Frontend (Vercel)**:
- Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Function Logs
- Or browser console (F12)

**Backend (Render)**:
- Dashboard ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Logs
- Look for upload-related errors

## Example URLs

If your Render backend is: `webchat-api.onrender.com`

Then your Vercel environment variables should be:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://webchat-api.onrender.com/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://webchat-api.onrender.com
```

And your Render environment variable should be:
```bash
CLIENT_URL=https://web-chat-lac.vercel.app
```

## Quick Fix Script

If still having issues, try this:

1. **On Render:**
   ```
   CLIENT_URL=https://web-chat-lac.vercel.app
   ```
   ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Wait for restart

2. **On Vercel:**
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
   VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
   ```
   ‚Üí Redeploy (no cache)

3. **Clear browser:**
   - Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear all cached images and files
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

4. **Test:**
   - Upload a small image
   - Check browser console
   - Check Render logs

## Success Indicators

When working correctly:

1. Browser console shows:
   ```
   üì§ Uploading file: image.jpg
   üì§ Request data: {...}
   ‚úÖ File uploaded successfully
   ```

2. Render logs show:
   ```
   üì• Upload request received
   üìÅ File upload initiated
   ‚òÅÔ∏è Uploading to Cloudinary...
   ‚úÖ File uploaded to Cloudinary
   üíæ Message saved to database
   ```

3. File appears in chat immediately
4. Other user receives file in real-time
5. Can download file by clicking
6. File stored in Cloudinary dashboard

## Still Not Working?

1. **Check exact error message** in browser console
2. **Check Render logs** for backend errors
3. **Verify Cloudinary credentials** in Render env vars
4. **Test health endpoint**: `https://backend.onrender.com/api/health`
5. **Try uploading very small file** (< 1MB) to rule out size issues
6. **Check file type** - ensure it's in allowed list
